# **Angular Solar System** 🪐

## **Description** 🚀
Angular Solar System is a project developed as part of my studies to improve my skills in Angular. I'm using Trybe projects (Trybe teaches React) as a guide to do the same project in Angular. It is a web application that allows users to explore and learn about the solar system. The application provides an interactive 3D visualization of the planets, along with information about each planet, its moons, and other celestial bodies.

## **Technologies Used** 🛠️
The project is built using the following technologies:

- Angular
- HTML5
- CSS3

## **Features** ✨
- Interactive 3D visualization of the solar system.
- Detailed information about each planet, including its name, size, distance from the sun, and composition.
- Information about the moons of each planet.
- Navigation controls to explore the solar system from different angles.
